## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `/discuss` skill at `skills/discuss/SKILL.md` for Claude Code, Codex, and other agents honoring `~/.agents/skills/`. Launches `discuss <file>`, streams stdout events via Monitor, and posts "takes" in response to user-opened threads.
- `install.sh` symlinks `skills/discuss/` into `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, and `~/.agents/skills/` when run from a clone.
- Skill self-bootstraps the binary on first use: detects missing `discuss`, prompts the user, runs `curl | sh` the installer, and falls back to `~/.discuss/bin/discuss` if PATH is stale.
- Skill is also installable via `npx skills add codesoda/discuss-cli` (vercel-labs/skills), with the binary bootstrapping lazily on first invocation.
- `README.md` with install paths, agent-first quick start, and API reference.

### Changed
- **Breaking for stdout consumers:** `take.added`, `draft.updated`, and `draft.cleared` events no longer emit to stdout. These kinds remain on the SSE channel for the browser UI. `EventKind::ALL` shrinks from 11 to 8 variants.
- Repository metadata points at `codesoda/discuss-cli` (was `chrisraethke/discuss-cli`).
- `CLAUDE.md` consolidated to a single-line `@AGENTS.md` include; Rust Patterns content moved into `AGENTS.md` so Claude Code and Codex read the same source of truth.

### Removed
- `tasks/prd-discuss-cli.md` (gitignored; the PRD is no longer tracked).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Canonical first-release smoke test: push the `v0.1.0` tag to trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`, publish `discuss-v0.1.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`, and attach `checksums-sha256.txt`.
